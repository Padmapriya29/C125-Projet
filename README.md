Jerry’s grandmother was an eminent doctor in the late 60s. Jerry just found his grandmother’s old diary in his house’s storeroom. However, the handwriting in the diary is not legible.  Jerry wants to use Machine Learning to detect the alphabets in his grandmother’s diary. Can you help Jerry write code for a classifier to predict individual alphabets in his grandmother’s diary?
